# Pathfinding-Visualizer
This project is a realtime visualization of pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra's and A* search.

**How to use:**

- Right click to place or remove a wall (black).
- Left click to select the starting and end nodes respectively (green).
- Watch the searching algorithm in action, yellow squares represent visited nodes.
- After the end node has been found, a red path will be formed from the start to end.
